//! Middleware and Service Abstractions for HTTP/3 Clients
//!
//! This `middleware` module provides traits and utilities for building composable,
//! dynamic HTTP services and middleware for use with `IrohH3Client`.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! - `Service`: Basic request → response async handler.
//! - `Middleware`: Wraps a `Service` and can modify requests or responses.
//! - `Pipeline`: A dynamic boxed service used inside `IrohH3Client`.
